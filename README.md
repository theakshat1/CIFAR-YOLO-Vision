# CIFAR-YOLO-Vision
This repository contains code for image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, as well as object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.

The image classification model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, while the YOLO algorithm is implemented using OpenCV and Darknet. The repository provides a comprehensive example of how to train a CNN for image classification and perform object detection on images. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of results. It serves as a practical guide for understanding and implementing these computer vision techniques.
